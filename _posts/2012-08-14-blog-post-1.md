# Review: A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits

The paper gives a nice mental model to think about transformers and attention heads. This is helpful in reasoning about big models.

At a lot of points, computations in the transformer are re-strcutred for efficiency, but that makes the operations less human understandable. 

The residual stream is a critical concept when we talk about transformers.
