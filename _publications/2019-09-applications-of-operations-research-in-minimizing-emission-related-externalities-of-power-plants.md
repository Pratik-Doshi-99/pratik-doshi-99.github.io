This is a research project that aims to use Operations Research Techniques to optimize the location of power plants to minimize the pollutant exposure of surrounding habitations. The said framework is generic enough to accommodate any pollutant emitting source and accounts for the population density of the surrounding regions to give an accurate answer.
